# CommaSpeedChallenge - Can we predict vehicle speed using only dashcam video and computer vision?

This repository contains the work for my attempt at the CommaSpeedChallenge (about four years to late, I know). The goal of the challenge is to use machine learning to predict the speed of a car from a dashcam video. The challenge provides a labeled dataset of video shot at 20 fps totaling to 20400 frames and their corresponding speeds. The challenge also contains an unlabeled test video which you can submit to the company for grading.

## [Related Work](#Related-Work)
I am entering this challenge with minimal to no computer vision experience. All of my prior projects are in natural language processing, so related work research was a necessary task for this endevour. CommaAI seems to attact very smart people, so finding prior attempts at this challenge on GitHub was often accompanied by well-organized and relevant research already conducted for me. This [page](https://github.com/ryanchesler/comma-speed-challenge/blob/master/README.md#Prior-speed-challenge-work) was particulary useful.
